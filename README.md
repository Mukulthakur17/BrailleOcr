# BrailleOcr
A dynamic braille system that coverts text into the braille language using opencv, tesseract OCR and arduino.
We used 6 servo motors to represent the 6 dots in the braille. As we detect the alphabet, the formation of the servo motors changes in accordance with the pattern of the respective alphabet in braille system. We use arduino uno to control those servo motors.
